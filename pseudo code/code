  * It should display 4 lines of alien in starting from the top of the grid -> create a start button that will start a delayed timer (how to back the whole page a bit greyed out for )
    # draw 4 lines of 10 alines 
    # start the alien movement after 1 second -> delayed how to start moving the aliens? how to calculate when they should drop a line? the cat classwork will somehow show how to calculate the movement of them
    # in that timer there should be a statement that checks if that player has shooted all aliens or the aliens reached the player 'game over' function
    # randomly chooses the aliengrid to drop a bomb in every 0.5 second is this a different intervall?
  * middle lower grid where the weapon is start

    # set up event listeners fot the keys to move the weapon (left,right, up for shooting) movePlayer function
    # block the them to be of off the grid (cat classwork)
  * It should start an interwall at the same time 
    # set up an interwall that changes every time a full cycle has completed 
  * Sould have some music at the background
  
  

2. game has started
  * 4 lines of alien start moving starting to the right side all together
    # alienMovement fucntion -> I don't know how 
    # once they all wento to right and left they drop a line down -> check out 7/10 classwork cat 

  * once they came back to the left side of the grid they should go down one line 
    # check out 7/10 classwork cat -> make sure they disappear as they moving (disappear function)
  * they should fire randomly to the players direction
    # they should check if they hit the players fire and then both shoots should be destroyed
